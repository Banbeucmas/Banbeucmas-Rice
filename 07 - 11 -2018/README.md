# Information
This is my Ricing on 07 - 09 - 2018, using bspwm

P.S: It is really the last one with slight modifcation. Doesn't chance much

**Additional Information**
* If somebody doesn't know about those fancy effect in the terminal (You should already know it) then it is [pipe.sh](https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh), [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix), [cli-visualizer](https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer)
* [Nemo](https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo) was used as the File Manager
* IntelliJ is the IDE Shown in the image, Theme was achived by using the Material UI Theme Plugin - Monokai Dark was used as a theme with some slight modification with the editor
* Theme: gruvbox for VIM, Numix Darkblue for GTK
* Wallpaper original source: https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=66444938. Artist is rokusai, show him some love on his pixiv
* The rest are pretty much self explainatory by looking at the screenshot so I won't cover it here
* Polybar was used in the Rice
* Song played
* [「アノインシスター」 【凋叶棕】](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPGZsAG7G3Y)
* [「ノーモア、エニモア？モアーモア？！」 【凋叶棕】](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1fAY3Q7xOQ)
* RD-Sounds is one of my favorite artist to date. His music along with Meramipop unique voice beats me. Besure to give the circle some support by buying their album [「逆」](http://www.rd-sounds.com/c94_seal_inside.html) if you love their work :D
