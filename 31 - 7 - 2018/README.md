# Information
This is my Ricing on 31 - 7 - 2018, first time getting used to i3. All suggestion for improving my rice is welcome

**Additional Information**
* The blur effect is achieved by using a fork of compton provided by Tryone144: https://github.com/tryone144/compton
* I don't know how to get markdown in INI with Nano so please tell me if somebody knows
* The wallpaper image is resized to fit my screen but also I did it because I found the resolution is a little bit odd for me; For anyone want to have the full resolution, it is [here](https://raikou2.donmai.us/97/51/__hakurei_reimu_touhou_drawn_by_eho_icbm__975139db42ef773e1c8f54a9b297a2b3.jpg). Artist is eho (also known as icbm), [please show him some love](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=146732)
